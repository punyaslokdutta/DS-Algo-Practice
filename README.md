1. Sliding Window
2. Two Pointers or Iterators
3. Fast and Slow pointers
4. Merge Intervals
5. Cyclic sort
6. In-place reversal of linked list
7. Tree BFS
8. Tree DFS
9. Two heaps
10. Subsets
11. Modified binary search
12. Top K elements
13. K-way Merge
14. Topological sort
15. 0/1 Knapsack
16. Unbounded Knapsack
17. Fibonacci Numbers
18. Palindromic Subsequence
19. Ad hoc/string manipulations
20. Hash tables(checkout language-specific implementation of hashing)
21. Array-related questions need to be practiced a lot because they need maximum logic, in my opinion. Only through practice will you learn certain intricate tricks.

## Tips & Tricks ##
Every interview prep should be divided into three stages:

1. Start brushing up your concepts and practice a few easy-medium level questions just to get reacquainted with the coding platforms and such. Also, devise a proper timetable if you only have a few days to prepare because otherwise, you will end up wasting time on concepts you are strong at. (1–2 days)
2. Start reading medium-hard questions and first solving them using a pen and paper. Trust me, don’t try to do it all in your head. It would be best if you use the pen and paper habit to tackle the intricacies of the question(I had to force myself to do this so that I would stop missing edge cases in the first attempt to finish the code quickly).Also, we can think better when we can visualize the problem, so please follow this one. Another thing to keep in mind is to analyze your performance and understand your weaknesses at the end of each day. Slowly you need to follow practices that can help you tackle those weaknesses. In this step, also make sure to bookmark concepts or questions you want to revise at the end. (5–6 days)
3. Finally, when you get to a confident stage in all your basic data structures. Move to mock interviews, or prepare other soft skills like explaining your solution out loud or on pen and paper, or even practicing how to code in a google doc or on the whiteboard. Also, in the end, you need to revise the concepts that you marked in the previous step. (2–4 days)
